1. Introduction                         *ruby-autocomplete-introduction*

vim-ruby-autocomplete is a small plugin to easy use the solargraph ruby 
completion server with help of LanguageClient-neovim for Vim8/Neovim.

It is only a wrapper that starts/stops solargraph for you and provides 
information how to use this plugin with vim completion engines like
completor or deoplete and was made because existing ruby-completion plugins
didn't worked for the author.

Tested system configurations:
- Arch/Manjaro Linux
- Ruby 2.6.*
- Vim 8.1
- Terminal: Konsole

==============================================================================
2. Requirements                         *ruby-autocomplete-requirements*

To use this plugin you need Vim8 or Neovim with python support installed.

As additional third-party-requirements you have to install ruby and 
following gems:
    
    $ gem install rdoc yarn solargraph irb rubocop

After Solargraph has installed you need to add the follwing line 
into your .bashrc:

    PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.gem/ruby/<your-ruby-verion>/bin

This ensures that your cli finds your solargraph binary files.

You also need the LanguageClient-neovim plugin by autozimu:

==============================================================================
3. Installation                         *ruby-autocomplete-installation*

It is very recommended to use one of various plugin managers for vim 
to install vim-ruby-autocomplete and the required LanguageClient-neovim.

Please read the instructions of one of them how to install the plugin:
* Pathogen  https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
* Vundle    https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
* Vim-Plug  https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug 
* Dein      https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim

==============================================================================
4. Configuration                        *ruby-autocomplete-configuration*

When correctly installed the plugin will autostart Solargraph every time 
after Vim has started. If additional ruby files are opened in the same Vim
session (new buffer, tabs) the current Solargraph connection will be used.
If Vim is closing, the Solargraph socket server will also be stopped.

There are a view variables that can be changed in your .vimrc file:

    let g:solargraph_listen_manually = 1 " default 0
    
    If this variable is set to 1 Solargraph need to be started by the 
    user themself. Than you have to execute '$ solargraph socket' in another
    terminal or write a custom systemd entry to autostart Solargraph.
    By default Solargraph starts/stops with Vim.

    let g:solargraph_listen_time = 300 " (in milliseconds, default 500 ms)

    This variable controls how long Vim is waiting before it is starting
    when g:solargraph_listen_manually is set to 0. It is recommended because
    the Solargraph socket server needs up to a second until it is complety
    started. If the time is set to short, Ruby autocompletion will not work.
    On a later plugin version it is planned to make this asynchronous and 
    the user will not have any waiting time on starting Vim.

    The time you need to setup depends on how long your processor needs to
    start the Solargraph socket server (should be between 100ms and 1000ms).


==============================================================================
5. Getting started                      *ruby-autocomplete-getting-started*

If all requirements are installed correctly you can test the autocompletion
by execute the Vim's omnifunc hotkey <C-X><C-O>

If you are more familiar with <Ctrl-Space> to trigger autocompletion you could
add this setting on your .vimrc: <C-@> <C-X><X-O>

==============================================================================
6. Completion methods                   *ruby-autocomplete-methods*

If you use Vim as active developing plattform it is recommended to use one
of serveral completion engines. Here are a view examples how to setup them
with this plugin.

MUComplete/Supertab:
    With both plugins completion should be enabled on pushing tab.

Completor:
    let g:completor_ruby_omni_trigger = '(\.[$\w]\*|::[$\w]\*)$'

Neocomplete:
    let g:neocomplete#sources#omni#input_patterns = {
    \   "ruby" : '[^. *\t]\.\w*\|\h\w*::',
    \}
    

==============================================================================
7. Troubeshooting                       *ruby-autocomplete-troubeshooting*

If errors occur / autocompletion does not work please be sure that:

- All requirements are installed correctly
- Bash knows the PATH of solargraph 
    $ solargraph help   or  $ which solargraph
- Start the solargraph socket server and show if errors are thrown
    $ solargraph socket
- In Vim open :terminal and test if solargraph is running:
    $ ps -aux | grep solargraph 
- Look if Vim throws errors on the status/execution line

==============================================================================
